# cpc2.github.io

This is the beta site imagemasker.github.io with updated CSS, mask rotation and experimental features. 

## TODO

* Fix a couple of issues and minor UI detail, but that's it. 
* More editing tools? (as long as it doesn't get too heavy)
* Clean everything, it has become an unoptimized mess
