# ImageMasker 2.0

This is a fork of imagemasker.github.io with updated CSS, mask rotation and experimental features. 

## TODO

* Drag and drop files - Not a priority
* More editing tools? (as long as it doesn't get too heavy)
* "My masks" section with custom uploaded masks? - Tried it and I wasn't too convinced
* Clean everything, it has become an unoptimized mess
