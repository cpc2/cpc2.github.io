# ImageMasker 2.0

This is a fork of imagemasker.github.io with updated CSS, mask rotation and experimental features. 

## TODO

* Drag and drop files
* Fix issues on mobile browsers
* More editing tools? (as long as it doesn't get too heavy)
* "My masks" section with custom uploaded masks?
* Clean everything
